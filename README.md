# Readme

This is my very first website using [jekyll-theme-leaf](https://supunkavinda.github.io/jekyll-theme-leaf/) from [Supun Kavinda](https://twitter.com/_SupunKavinda). The goal of this website is to have a kind of "online storage" for any log, note, script, etc. I write while i'm learning pentesting. Hope you find it useful!
