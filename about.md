Hi i'm <a rel="me" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mars_verdaguer">Pau</a>! Welcome to my Github hosted website. Here i'll be posting all my logs, records and notes while i learn Pentesting from zero. My goal is to become a profficient pentester and share my experience while learning as well as any tool or script i develop throughout the process.

In my daily life, i am an EASA commercial pilot and a mountaineer. Flying is my passion. Mountaineering reminds me that you have to work hard to reach the summit but without forgetting the path. I'm very passionate about what i do and coding is an skill i've always wanted to deepen. I hope you find this site as useful as i find many others, if you want to contact me don't hesitate to visit <a href="./contact">contact</a> page.

I don't use Arch Linux, BTW!<br>Pau
